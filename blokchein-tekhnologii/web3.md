# Web3

Web3’s defining feature is ownership. Whereas the first iteration of the commercial internet (Web1) was **read-only** for most users, and Web2 allowed users to both **read & write** on centralized platforms (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc), Web3 gives users full ownership over their content, data, and assets via blockchains. It empowers users to **read-write-own.**
